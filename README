Quantitive Data Flow Tracking graph (qDFTgraph) library.

1) How to install
2) How to use it

*** HOW TO INSTALL ***

  For general free software install rules, please refer to INSTALL
  file.  This C++ library is based on Boost Graph Library (BGL). You
  need a recent installation of this library and in case of a manual
  installation you might need to tell to qDFTgraph where is located
  your Boost installation. For example:

  If you've installed one of the required libraries in a non classical
  path, you may need to tell to configure how to find it. For example,
  assume BGL headers are in $HOME/include and BGL libraries are in
  $HOME/lib, the following command tell to configure where they are:
  ./configure --with-boost=$HOME

** Tips on manual installation of Boost library **
  + under a Unix-like system:
  extract boost archive then go in it and enter the two following
  commands:  
  $ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$HOME
  $ ./b2 install
  $ sudo ldconfig $HOME/lib

  Now Boost is correctly installed in your $HOME directory. You just
  have to tell to configure where to look for (as explained
  previously).

*** HOW TO USE IT ***

  qDFTgraph is a header library, then it does not need to be compiled
  first. The only thing needed is to include qdft.hh header in your
  program. A example is provided inside src directory. Look at
  src/example.cc for further information.

	src/test_lib.cc is a file transfer simulator. It simulates transfers
	of different sizes between a set of files.
